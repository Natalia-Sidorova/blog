## Overview

1. Last week I was preparing for a calculus test. It was interesting, but very difficult.

2. March 8 was a holiday - International Women's Day. I celebrated it with people dear to me.

3. Felt bad for several days and did not do laboratory work, I had to shift my work schedule and set aside time to complete these works.
