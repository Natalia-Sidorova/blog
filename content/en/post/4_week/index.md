## Overview

1. This week I finally completed the operating systems labs and started learning German. Mathematics has become more difficult, but soon the tests and you need to understand these subjects

2. It was warm and sunny in the first half of the week, so I visited the Moscow Zoo and the Botanical Garden of Moscow State University. It was exciting! I got a good impression and took a lot of beautiful photos.
